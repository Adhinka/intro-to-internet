                                <p><b>Seijin-chan (星人ちゃん, English: "<em>Ms. Alien</em>")</b> is an avatar  
                                    made by Adhinka and is used as her internet identity, especially within 
                                    the art community. Seijin is portrayed as an alien-like character and is 
                                    often drawn in Japanese chibi-style. Under this name, she posts some of her 
                                    artworks mainly through Instagram and Discord. She is also open for custom 
                                    art commissions, both domestic (Indonesia) and international orders. During 
                                    her free time, Seijin loves to draw characters from TV shows that she likes 
                                    or her original characters.
                                </p>
                                <p>Seijin's art style is mainly inspired by <em>manga</em> (Japanese-styled cartoon) 
                                    with a touch of pop <em>webtoon</em> (web-based comics) for coloring. She 
                                    developed the style herself, by self-learning how to draw traditionally 
                                    since the 2<sup>nd</sup> grade of elementary school by imitating comic characters 
                                    such as Conan from Case Closed (Detective Conan) and Naruto.

                            <h2>Early Design Prototype</h2>
                            <div class="inline-content">
                                <img width="150" src="images/seijin-prototype.png" alt="Seijin-chan">
                                <p>Seijin's early design basically has a more <b>dark and gloomy vibes</b>, 
                                    due to the color palette that was chosen came from one of her favorite 
                                    colors which is <b>eigengrau</b>. Since Seijin means 'alien', the character 
                                    has antennae as her special feature. In this prototype, her hair was drewn 
                                    short with bangs covering her eyes, and she wore a simple black or 
                                    eigengrau-colored shirt.
                                </p>
                                <p>The design looked well (although people failed to tell that Seijin is a girl), but 
                                    somehow the theme and design did not match quiet well. Despite the meaning 
                                    of her name (alien), she decided to pick her name since Seijin itself comes 
                                    from 2 chinese characters which represents <b>star</b> (星) and <b>person</b> 
                                    (人). She evaluated that the combination of the 2 chinese characters should symbolically 
                                    represents something more cheerful. Therefore, she changed the design to a 
                                    more cheerful one with a combination of <b>falun red</b>, black, and grey.
                                </p>

                            <h2>Parody to Reality</h2>
                            <div class="inline-content">
                                <img width="150" src="images/seijin-genderbend.png" alt="Seijin-chan">
                                <p>Seijin actually has a <b>genderbend</b> alter called <b>Seijin-kun</b> 
                                    (sometimes 'Seijoe'), which is a male version of her. The idea comes 
                                    from an inside joke within one of the Discord art communities she belonged to. 
                                    Seijin tested an AI chatbot in the internet along with her friends. She 
                                    typed her name to see if the bot understood, but due to a bug, the bot 
                                    answered by 'Hello, Joe' instead of 'Hello, Seijin'.
                                </p>
                                <p>One of her friends 
                                    said '<b>Seijoe</b>' as a pun for 'Seijin + Joe', and it was widely spreading. 
                                    From that day, she decided to create an alternative form of Seijin-chan. 
                                    The official name of the genderbend version is 'Seijin-kun' as opposed to 
                                    'Seijin-chan' (<em>-kun</em> is a Japanese suffix for male, while <em>-chan</em> 
                                    is for female), but some people who are familiar with the joke often use 
                                    'Seijoe' instead
                                </p>
